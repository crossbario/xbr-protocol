The XBR Protocol
================

---------

The **XBR Protocol** enables secure peer-to-peer data-trading and -service microtransactions in
`Open Data Markets <https://xbr.network>`__ between multiple independent entities.

XBR as a protocol sits on top of `WAMP <https://wamp-proto.org>`__, an open messaging middleware and service mesh technology,
and enables secure integration, trusted sharing and monetization of data and data-driven microservices
between different parties and users.

The XBR Protocol specification is openly developed and freely usable.

The protocol is implemented in *smart contracts* written in `Solidity <https://solidity.readthedocs.io>`__
and open-source licensed (`Apache 2.0 <https://github.com/crossbario/xbr-protocol/blob/master/LICENSE>`__).
Smart contracts are designed to run on the `Ethereum blockchain <https://ethereum.org/>`__.
All source code for the XBR smart contracts is developed and hosted in the
project main `GitHub repository <https://github.com/crossbario/xbr-protocol>`__.

The XBR Protocol and reference documentation can be found `here <https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/xbr.foundation/docs/protocol/index.html>`__.

Contract addresses
------------------

Contract addresses for local development on Ganache, using the

.. code:: console

   export XBR_HDWALLET_SEED="myth like bonus scare over problem client lizard pioneer submit female collect"

which result in the following contract addresses (when the deployment is the very first transactions on Ganache):

.. code:: console

   export XBR_DEBUG_TOKEN_ADDR=0xCfEB869F69431e42cdB54A4F4f105C19C080A601
   export XBR_DEBUG_NETWORK_ADDR=0xC89Ce4735882C9F0f0FE26686c53074E09B0D550
   export XBR_DEBUG_MARKET_ADDR=0x9561C133DD8580860B6b7E504bC5Aa500f0f06a7
   export XBR_DEBUG_CATALOG_ADDR=0xD833215cBcc3f914bD1C9ece3EE7BF8B14f841bb
   export XBR_DEBUG_CHANNEL_ADDR=0xe982E462b094850F12AF94d21D470e21bE9D0E9C

Application development
-----------------------

The XBR smart contracts primary build artifacts are the `contract ABIs JSON files <https://github.com/crossbario/xbr-protocol/tree/master/abi>`__.
The ABI files are built during compiling the `contract sources <https://github.com/crossbario/xbr-protocol/tree/master/contracts>`__.
Technically, the ABI files are all you need to interact and talk to the XBR smart contracts deployed to a blockchain
from any (client side) language or run-time that supports Ethereum, such as
`web3.js <https://web3js.readthedocs.io>`__ or `web3.py <https://web3py.readthedocs.io>`__.

However, this approach (using the raw XBR ABI files directly from a "generic" Ethereum client library) can be cumbersome
and error prone to maintain. An alternative way is using a client library with built-in XBR support.

The XBR project currently maintains the following **XBR-enabled client libraries**:

-  `XBR (contract ABIs package) <https://pypi.org/project/xbr/>`__ for Python
-  `Autobahn|Python <https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-python>`__ for Python (uses the XBR package)
-  `Autobahn|JavaScript <https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-js>`__ for JavaScript, in browser and NodeJS
-  `Autobahn|Java <https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-java>`__ (*beta XBR support*) for Java on Android and Java 8 / Netty
-  `Autobahn|C++ <https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-cpp>`__ (*XBR support planned*) for C++ 11+ and Boost/ASIO

XBR support can be added to any `WAMP client library <https://wamp-proto.org/implementations.html#libraries>`__
with a language run-time that has packages for Ethereum application development.

Build and Release
-----------------

Ethereum
........

To build and release the XBR contracts on Ethereum (Rinkeby), set your ``XBR_HDWALLET_SEED`` and run:

.. code:: console

   export XBR_HDWALLET_SEED="uncover current ...
   make clean compile deploy_rinkeby


Documentation
.............

To build and publish the `XBR contracts documentation <https://xbr.network/docs/protocol/index.html>`__:

.. code:: console

   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   make clean docs publish_docs


Docker
......

The following is for building our development blockchain Docker image, which contains
Ganache with the XBR smart contracts already deployed into, and with initial balances
for testaccounts (both ETH and XBR).

The deploying user account 0 becomes contracts owner, and the user is derived from a seedphrase
read from an env var:

.. code:: console

   export XBR_HDWALLET_SEED="myth like bonus scare over problem client lizard pioneer submit female collect"

The resulting contract addresses, which must be used by XBR clients:

.. code:: console

   export XBR_DEBUG_TOKEN_ADDR=0x254dffcd3277C0b1660F6d42EFbB754edaBAbC2B
   export XBR_DEBUG_NETWORK_ADDR=0xC89Ce4735882C9F0f0FE26686c53074E09B0D550

The Docker images are published to:

* `public <https://hub.docker.com/r/crossbario/crossbarfx-blockchain>`__
* `admin <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/crossbario/crossbarfx-blockchain>`__

Building the Docker Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clean file staging area to create blockchain docker image and run a blockchain from the
empty staging area:

.. code:: console

   make clean_ganache run_ganache

Compile XBR contracts, deploy to the blockchain and initialize blockchain data

.. code:: console

   make compile deploy_ganache init_ganache

Now stop the blockchina, and build the Docker image using the initialized data
from the staging area, and publish the image:

.. code:: console

   make build_ganache_docker publish_ganache_docker:


Python
......

To build and release the XBR contract ABIs Python package **xbr**:

.. code:: console

   make clean compile build_python publish_python

.. note::

   In general, the Python package should have the same version as the XBR contracts
   tagged and deployed. Also the ABI bundle archives (ZIP files) should be in-sync
   to the former as well.
